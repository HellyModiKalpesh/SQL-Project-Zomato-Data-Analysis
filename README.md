## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato_db` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## Tables

- **restaurants**: Information about restaurants (e.g., name, city, opening hours).
- **customers**: Details of registered customers.
- **riders**: Information about riders and sign-up dates.
- **orders**: Tracks orders placed by customers, including status and amount.
- **deliveries**: Delivery details, including rider and status.

## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE zomato_db;
```

### 1. Dropping Existing Tables
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;

-- 2. Creating Tables
CREATE TABLE restaurants (
    restaurant_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    restaurant_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(50),
    opening_hours VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    reg_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE riders (
    rider_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rider_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    sign_up DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    restaurant_id INT,
    order_item VARCHAR(255),
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    order_time TIME NOT NULL,
    order_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES restaurants(restaurant_id)
);

CREATE TABLE deliveries (
    delivery_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    delivery_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    delivery_time TIME,
    rider_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (rider_id) REFERENCES riders(rider_id)
);
```

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

Before performing analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary. For instance:

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET total_amount = COALESCE(total_amount, 0);
```

## Business Problems Solved

### 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.
### 2. Popular Time Slots
-- Question: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals.
### 3. Order Value Analysis
-- Question: Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 750 orders.
-- Return customer_name, and aov(average order value)
### 4. High-Value Customers
-- Question: List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders.
-- return customer_name, and customer_id!
### 5. Orders Without Delivery
-- Question: Write a query to find orders that were placed but not delivered. 
-- Return each restuarant name, city and number of not delivered orders
### 6. Restaurant Revenue Ranking: 
-- Rank restaurants by their total revenue from the last year, including their name, 
-- total revenue, and rank within their city.
### 7. Most Popular Dish by City: 
-- Identify the most popular dish in each city based on the number of orders.
### 8. Customer Churn: 
-- Find customers who havenâ€™t placed an order in 2024 but did in 2023.
### 9. Cancellation Rate Comparison: 
-- Calculate and compare the order cancellation rate for each restaurant between the 
-- current year and the previous year.
### 10. Rider Average Delivery Time: 
-- Determine each rider's average delivery time.
### 11. Monthly Restaurant Growth Ratio: 
-- Calculate each restaurant's growth ratio based on the total number of delivered orders since its joining
### 12. Customer Segmentation: 
-- Customer Segmentation: Segment customers into 'Gold' or 'Silver' groups based on their total spending 
-- compared to the average order value (AOV). If a customer's total spending exceeds the AOV, 
-- label them as 'Gold'; otherwise, label them as 'Silver'. Write an SQL query to determine each segment's 
-- total number of orders and total revenue
### 13. Rider Monthly Earnings: 
-- Calculate each rider's total monthly earnings, assuming they earn 8% of the order amount.
### Q.14 Rider Ratings Analysis: 
-- Find the number of 5-star, 4-star, and 3-star ratings each rider has.
-- riders receive this rating based on delivery time.
-- If orders are delivered less than 15 minutes of order received time the rider get 5 star rating,
-- if they deliver 15 and 20 minute they get 4 star rating 
-- if they deliver after 20 minute they get 3 star rating.
### 15. Q.15 Order Frequency by Day: 
-- Analyze order frequency per day of the week and identify the peak day for each restaurant.
### 16. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): 
-- Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer over all their orders.
### 17. Monthly Sales Trends: 
-- Identify sales trends by comparing each month's total sales to the previous month
### 18. Rider Efficiency: 
-- Evaluate rider efficiency by determining average delivery times and identifying those with the lowest and highest averages.
### 19. Order Item Popularity: 
-- Track the popularity of specific order items over time and identify seasonal demand spikes.
### 20. Rank each city based on the total revenue for last year 2023

## Conclusion
